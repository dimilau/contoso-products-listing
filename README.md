## Developers Note

Good day! Thank you for spending time to test out this sample.

Three mock users are available for testing purpose.

1. DIAMOND 
username: john
password: 123456

2. PLATINUM
username: jane
password: 123456

3. ASSOCIATE
username: jerry
password: 123456

They match the given example scenarios (as in the interview test PDF), except the Platinum one. According to my calculation, the given "Total Expected" in the PDF is not correct, can you please check? Thanks.

There are lots of refactorings that I would do, but I decided to stop here in the interest of time.

I regret to say test cases were not implemented here. I've written test cases in other projects, but I'll need to spend some time picking up on writing test for Angular. I'll leave it as a future exercise for now.

It has been fun picking up the latest Angular after a while.

Thank you, and I hope you have a good and productive day today.

Cheers,

LSW
